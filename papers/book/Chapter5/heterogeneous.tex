\subsection{Definition (2-D)}

The aim of this example is to simulate the stationary groundwater flow in an isotropic and heterogeneous porous medium. In order to consider the heterogeneous of hydraulic conductivity, a 2-D numerical model is built. The heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity is shown in Fig. \ref{KDis}. The aquifer is assumed isotropic, heterogeneous, saturated and stationary.

For the two-dimensional simulation, the cube consisting of a porous medium is simplified as a square with an area of 10000~m$^2$. The calculation model includes 10000 quad elements and 10201 nodes. At the left boundary  a constant head of 10~m and the right boundary  a constant head of 9~m are specified in order to create a pressure gradient. 

\subsection{Results (2-D)}

As shown in figure \ref{HeadDis}, the head distribution of the groundwater flow in a heterogeneous medium is depicted complying with the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity.

\subsection{Definition (3-D)}

For the three-dimensional simulation, the aquifer is defined as a 100~m$\times$ 100~m$\times$ 50~m cuboid. The calculation model includes 60025 hex elements and 65000 nodes.  A constant head of 10~m at the left surface and a constant head of 9~m at the right surface are specified in order to create a pressure gradient. The heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity is shown in Fig. \ref{KDis3d}.
