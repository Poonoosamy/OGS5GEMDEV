\subsection{Porous medium}

The above conservation principles are given for single phase systems.
A porous medium, however, consists of multiple phases (fluids such as water, air and non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) as well as solids). 
Moreover, these phases can contain several chemical components which can be dissolved in liquids or adsorbed to the solid phase (Fig. \ref{fig:pm1}).

The macroscopic balance equations are obtained by averaging procedures, normally under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (e.g. \cite{HasGra:79,Die:85}).
The volume fraction $\epsilon$ of phase $\alpha$ is defined as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon^\alpha
= \frac{\Omega^\alpha}{\Omega_0}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\Omega^\alpha$ if the volume of the porous medium occupied by phase $\alpha$ and $\Omega_0$ is the representative elementary volume of the porous medium (REV).
The porosity $n$ of the multi-phase medium is equal to
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_\gamma \epsilon^\gamma
= 
\Porosity
\quad,\quad
\epsilon^s
= \frac{\Omega^s}{\Omega_0}
= 1-\Porosity
\end{eqnarray}

where $\gamma$ is the fluid phase index.
If several fluid phases are present in porous medium they compete for the pore space.
%
Saturation of a fluid phase $\gamma$ is defined as the volumetric
fraction $\VolumetricFraction^\Phase$ related to the sum of all
fluid phases volumetric fractions.
\begin{eqnarray}
\Saturation^\Phase
=
\frac{\VolumetricFraction^\Phase}{\sum_\Phase \VolumetricFraction^\Phase}
\end{eqnarray}

The sum of saturations of all fluid phases must be equal to unity.
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_\Phase \Saturation^\Phase = 1
\end{eqnarray}

Tab. \ref{tab:conservation_quantities_pm} summarizes the balance quantities for mass, momentum, and energy conservation in a multi-phase porous medium. Phenomenological relationships concerning the fluxes have to be introduced, e.g. Darcy's and Fourier's laws, in order to close the balance equations.
%(see sec. \ref{sec:constitutive_equations_fluxes}).

% Formulations
There are four unknown field functions to determine:
gas pressure $\Pressure^g$,
water pressure $\Pressure^w$,
solid displacements $\Disp$ and
equilibrium temperature $\Temperature$.
%
In general there are two basic approaches to formulate the balance equations: phase and componental approaches.
%
For non-isothermal processes in partially saturated porous media,
it is more convenient to separate
dry air and vapour masses,
and formulate a mass balance equation for both liquid species,
i.e. liquid and liquid vapour (Gawin et al. 1995, see Chapter 16).

Concept for formulations:
compositional or phase-related approach.
The first approach consists of balancing the species
rather than the phases.
The componental approach is adopted to establish the mass balance equations.
