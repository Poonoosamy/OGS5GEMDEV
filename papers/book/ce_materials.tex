\section{Constitutive equations - Materials}
\label{sec:constitutive_equations_materials}

Constitutive relationships are necessary to specify the properties for fluid flow, heat transfer, swelling pressure and mechanical stress/deformation of the specific material under consideration. For determination of material properties laboratory tests have to be conducted. A number of material properties can not be determined directly.
This must be done by back analysis using inverse modeling.

For THM processes we have to consider 
hydraulic
(Section \ref{sec:h_properties}),
thermal,
(Section \ref{sec:t_properties})
and
mechanical properties
(Section \ref{sec:m_properties})
of the corresponding fluid and solid phases.
