\section{Theory}
%\GeoSys  (\gversion) can analyze 2D and 3D deformation
%problems of porous and fractured media. For 2D problems, we restrict the analysis under the
%assumption of plane strain.  Triangle and quadrilateral element
%types are available for 2D simulation. While, 3D simulations can
% use tetrahedron, hexahedron, prismatic elements.

Pure deformations in any media  can be described by the momentum
balance equation in the terms of stress as
\begin{equation}
\nabla \cdot \Stress + \dens\grv = 0
\label{eq:momb}
\end{equation}
where $\Stress$ is stress tensor, $\dens$ is the solid density. In the present implementation, the traditional sign
convention for stress and fluid pressure is used. Displacement $\Disp$ is the primary variable to be solved by
substituting the constitutive law for stress-strain behavior
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
 \Stress = \CT\, \StrainT\\
  \StrainT = \dfrac{1}{2}(\nabla \Disp+(\nabla \Disp)^{\mathrm T})
 \end{array}
 \label{eq:strstr}
\end{equation}
with $\CT$, a forth order material tensor and $\StrainT$, the
strain. Superscript $\mathrm T$ means the transpose of matrix. The
deformation problem can be considered as a boundary value problem
with boundary conditions given by
\begin{equation}
\Stress : \nrl = \bm t
\quad \mbox{or} \quad
\Disp = \Disp_{\scriptscriptstyle{\Gamma}},
\quad \forall\,\Point \in
\partial \Omega
\label{eq:debc}
\end{equation}
where $\nrl$ is the normal to the portion of domain surface on where
the traction boundary condition $\bm t$ is prescribed, $\Disp_{\scriptscriptstyle{\Gamma}}$ is the
 described displacement boundary values.

For 2D problems, we restrict the analysis under the
assumption of plane strain.
