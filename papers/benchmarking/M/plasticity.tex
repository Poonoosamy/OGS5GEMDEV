\section{Elasto-plasticity}

Plasticity is a property of a material to undergo a non-reversible change of shape in response to an applied force. During the elasto-plastic deformation, the onset of plasticity is determined by a yield criterion and post-yield deformation is governed by the yield criterion and a plastic potential. To illustrate features of elasto-plasticity deformation, we consider a uniaxial test of stress depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:uniax_test}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{M/figure/uniaxial.eps}
  \caption{Uniaxial test }
  \label{fig:uniax_test}
\end{figure}

This means only one direction has non-zero stress and strain,e.g $\stress=\sigma_{yy}$ and $\strain=\gamma_{yy}$.
Different material exhibits different elasto-plastic behavior. Fig. \ref{fig:uniax_lp} depicts a typical

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \label{fig:uniax_lp}
\end{figure}

stress-strain curve of the uniaxial test. If load $\stress$ is gradually increased, a corresponding point in $(\stress, \strain)$ plane are moving from 0 to A. Up to A, stress reaches a value $\Stress_0$, so called yield stress. If the load is removed gradually before its reaches the yield value, the point follows the line from A to 0. On the other hand, if the load is continually increased after stress is bigger than   $\Stress_0$, the material experiences plastic deformation. Assuming the curve is extended from A to B during load acting. If we remove the load gradually, the point  will not take the way its from, i.e. from B to A to 0. On the contrary, it will move from B to C linearly. Furthermore, if the load is applied again, the point will take the path from \mbox{C $\longrightarrow$ B $\longrightarrow$ D}.

This implies that: i) The unloading is elastic and there is still strain $\strain^p$ left after the load being removed,
Therefore, the plastic deformation is irreversible; ii) The strain is admissible to be decomposed into several
components, e.g. $\Stra=\Stra^e+\Stra^p$; iii) The relationship of stress-strain is history dependent curve.  Based on the last point and the  Hook's law, the constitutive equation for the 1D deformation problem can be described as

\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{yy}=E\varepsilon_{yy}^e=E(\varepsilon_{yy}-\varepsilon_{yy}^p)
\label{eqn:constitu_M_1D}
\end{eqnarray}

where $E$ is so called Young's modulus. If the stress-strain is monotonic increasing after yielding, the material shows hardening behavior. For some porous media, softening  behavior may be observed and its stress-strain curve looks like what depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:uniax_lp1}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \input{M/figure/plastics.eepic}
  \caption{Softening }
  \label{fig:uniax_lp1}
\end{figure}

For the constitutive equation, the case of more than one direction have non-zero stress and strain are much more complicated. A yield function $\yieldf$ and a plastic potential $\plsp$ are introduced to establish a constitutive equation. Normally, the variables of the two functions are the first, second or third stress invariant $\sivi$, $\sivii$ or $\siviii$. If we cast the yield functions to the principal stress space, we get the yield surfaces. Fig. \ref{fig:yieldsfc} depticts three typical yield surfaces of porous media.

   \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Yield surface}
  \label{fig:yieldsfc}
\end{figure}

If the stress path of any point locates inside the surface, the point undergoes elastic deformation. Otherwise, the stress status is determined by the Kuhn-Tucker criterion for the loading or unloading:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{kuhn_tucker}
\quad \dot{\yieldf} \leq 0, \,\, \dot{ \PlasticParameter}\,{\yieldf} = 0,\,\mbox{or},\,  \dot{ \PlasticParameter} \geq 0
\end{eqnarray}

is then used to check the yield status.

Since the stress path in plastic deformation is history dependent, we describe the constitutive equations in the sense of increment of stress and strain.
Considering the generalized Hook's law (\ref{eq:hook}),  the relationship of incremantal stress  tensor $d \Stress$ and incremantal strain tensor $d \Stra$ the relationship of
stress and strain obeys the generalized Hook's law:

\begin{eqnarray}
d\Stress
= {\mathbf D} d\Stra^e=
{\mathbf D} (d\Stra-d\Stra^p)
\label{eq:ghook}
\end{eqnarray}

From the definition of plastic potential surface $\plsp$, and
normality law, it is possible to express the generalized plastic
strain increment if the potential surface is smooth. Since
$d\Stra^p$ lies parallel to the normal to $\plsp$ at $\Stress$, we
may write

\begin{eqnarray}
d\Stra^p =d \PlasticParameter \frac{\partial \plsp}{\partial \Stress}
\label{eqn:flowrule}
\end{eqnarray}

where $d \PlasticParameter$ is non-negative factor, plastic
multiplier. Equaion (\ref{eqn:flowrule}) is so clalled flow rule. Hence, the general elasto-platic constitutive equation is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
d\Stress
= {\mathbf D} d\Stra^e=
{\mathbf D} (d\Stra-d \PlasticParameter \frac{\partial \plsp}{\partial \Stress})
\label{eq:constitu_m}
\end{eqnarray}.

The flow rule is associative if $\yieldf\equiv\plsp$. Otherwise, it is non-associative. Typical plastic models, i.e. yield  functions and plastic potentials are described below.

\textit{Drucker-Prager model}

This model is a function of the two stress invariants and hardening parameter. Its yield function takes the form

\begin{eqnarray}
\yieldf (\Stress, \kappa) =\left\Vert{\devS} \right\Vert+\alpha\sivi-y(\kappa)=0 \\
\plsp (\Stress, \kappa) =\left\Vert{\devS} \right\Vert+\beta \sivi-y(\kappa)=0
\label{eqn:dp}
\end{eqnarray}

where $\alpha$ is a coefficient related to the internal frictional angle, $y(\kappa)$ is the yield stress depending on the hardening parameter.

\textit{Cam-Clay model}

Similar to the Drucker-Prager model, the Cam-Clay model is a funtion of both of the first and the second stress invariants. The generalized Cam-Clay model reads:

\begin{eqnarray}
\yieldf=q^2+M^2\pm(\pm-\pm_{cn})=0
\label{eqn:cc}
\end{eqnarray}

where $q=\sqrt{3/2}=\left\Vert {\devS} \right\Vert$, $\pm=\sivi/3$ the mean stress, $M$ is the slope of the critical state line in a $q-\pm$ digram and $\pm_{cn}$ is the isotropic preconsolidation pressure. The rate of $\pm_{cn}$ is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
{\frac{\mathrm d\, \pm\phantom{^-_-}}{\mathrm d\,  \epsilon^p_v}}=\frac{(1+e)\pm}{\lambda_c-\kappa_c}
\label{eqn:cc_pcn}
\end{eqnarray}

with $e$ the void ratio, $\epsilon^p_v$ the volume plastic strain, $\lambda_c$ the virgin compression index and $\lambda_c$  the swelling/recompression index.

The model also describes the nonlinear elastic behavior of the clay-like media before plastic yielding occurs, in which the bulk modulus $K$ is dependent of stress status as

\begin{eqnarray}
K=\frac{1+e}{\kappa_c}\pm=0
\label{eqn:cc_K}
\end{eqnarray}

with $\mu=3(1-2\nu)K/(2(1+\nu))$.
