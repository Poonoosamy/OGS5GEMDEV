
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}

The aim of this example is to simulate the stationary groundwater flow in an isotropic and heterogeneous porous medium. In order to consider the heterogeneous of permeability, a 2~D numerical model was built. The heterogeneous distribution of permeability is showed in \ref{KDis}.

\subsubsection*{Model set-up of the 2~D numerical model}

For the 2-dimensional simulation, the cube consisting of a porous medium is simplified as a square with an area of 10000~m$^2$. The calculation model includes 10000 quad elements and 10201 nodes. At the left boundary  a constant head of 10~m and the right boundary  a constant head of 9~m are specified in order to create a pressure gradient. 

\subsubsection*{Results}

In figure \ref{HeadDis} the horizontal and vertical head distributions of a groundwater flow in a heterogeneous medium are depicted responsing to the distribution of the permeability.
