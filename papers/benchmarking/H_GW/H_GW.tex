\chapter{Groundwater flow -- H-Processes}
\label{sec:Groundwater}
%
This chapter deals with saturated subsurface flow. In the aquifer concept balance equations determine strictly horizontal flow and vertical flow can be included by leakage terms through confining beds. The leakage terms add or subtract water from aquifers overlying and underlying a leaky confining bed according to the aquifer's head difference and a confining bed conductivity. An aquifer which contains a water table is termed unconfined and a completely filled aquifer is termed confined. The governing equations for three-dimensional groundwater, confined, and unconfined aquifer flow are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:Groundwater_theory}.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:Groundwater_confined} the benchmarks for confined and in Sec.~\ref{sec:Groundwater_unconfined} for unconfined aquifers are introduced. Groundwater flow is solved two- and three dimensionally in the benchmark examples.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:Groundwater_theory}
%
A three-dimensional description of groundwater flow is given by the mass balance equation
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_s\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
- \nabla\cdot \frac{\rho g}{\mu} {\kappa} \nabla h
= q^{ex}
\label{eqn:GW_Governing}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where the head $h$ is the primary variable of groundwater flow and $S_s$ is the specific storage which is assumed to be independent of the head neglecting fluid and soil matrix compression. Use of Darcy's law for momentum balance leads to the fluid density $\rho$, dynamic fluid viscosity $\mu$, gravity constant $g$, and aquifer permeability matrix ${\kappa}$. Finally $q^{ex}$ denotes external sources and sinks.
Depth integration leads to the two-dimensional Boussinesq equation which describes unconfined aquifers and reads
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S_y\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
- \nabla\cdot \frac{\rho g h}{\mu}  {\kappa}  \nabla h
= q^{ex}
\label{eqn:GW_unconfinedGoverning}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $S_y$ is the specific yield.
For confined aquifers Eq.~\ref{eqn:GW_unconfinedGoverning} becomes
%
\begin{eqnarray}
S\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
- \nabla\cdot \frac{\rho g L}{\mu}  {\kappa}  \nabla h
 = q^{ex}
\label{eqn:GW_confinedGoverning}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $S$ is the storage and $L$ the aquifer thickness.
The aquifer thickness $L$ is taken into account by changing the soil permeability ${\kappa }$ in the following benchmark examples.
A channel source term can be assigned according to
%
\begin{eqnarray}
q^{ex} = K_{\Lambda} \frac{P}{B}\frac{h^{sur} - h^{sub}}{a}
\label{eqn:GW_riverSource}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $K_{\Lambda}$ is the channel bed conductivity, $B$ the channel width, $a$ the channel bed thickness, and $h^{sur}$ the channel flow head. The wetted perimeter $P= 2 (h^{sur}-z^{sur}) + B$ for rectangular channel where $z^{sur}$ is the height of the top of the channel bed. Groundwater head $h$ is taken into account by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h^{sub} = \max\left( h, z^{sur}\right).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Leakage terms between adjacent aquifers can be defined accordingly.

\subsection{Constant source term}
\label{sec:Groundwater_confined_source}
%
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}
%
These examples deal with an aquifer which is subject to a constant recharge line source.
\cite{Glover:78} presented an analytical solution for a constant line source on an infinite domain which reads for the groundwater head at the source
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h = q^{ex}\sqrt{ \frac{\mu t}{\pi \rho g k L S_y}}. \label{GW_Glover}
\end{eqnarray}
%
The aquifer size is $20m\times 10m$ with the source term at one boundary (See Fig.~\ref{GW_riv1_domain}). The simulation time is $30min$.
%
\subsubsection*{Initial and boundary conditions}
%
Initial groundwater head is $0m$. The source term is $2\times 10^{-4} m/s$, groundwater head is $0$ at the opposite boundary, and at the remaining part no-flow is imposed.
\subsubsection*{Material properties}
%
For the spatial discretization $24\times 12$ quadrants or hexahedra are used. The hexahedra have a height of $1m$.
Material parameters are given in Tab.~\ref{GW_SourceTerm}.

\subsection{Channel source term}
\label{sec:Groundwater_confined_channelSource}
%
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}
%
For these examples the source term of the previous examples (Sec.~\ref{sec:Groundwater_confined_source}) is substituted by a corresponding channel source term (Eqn.~\ref{eqn:GW_riverSource}). The channel is assumed to be not affected by the water loss and the exchange flux is independent of the groundwater head. Therefore, the source term represents a steady and uniform channel located above the aquifer. The cross-section of the channel is rectangular. The setup, spatial discretization, and calculated water head are shown in Fig.~\ref{GW_riv1_domain}. The simulation time is $30min$.

\caption{Computational domain and (channel) source term location}
 \label{GW_riv1_domain}
\end{figure}

%
\subsubsection*{Initial and boundary conditions}
%
The initial groundwater head is $0m$. The channel source term is the boundary condition at one side, at the opposite boundary the head is fixed $0$. At the remaining boundaries no-flow is imposed.
\subsubsection*{Material properties}
%
For the spatial discretization either $24\times 12$ quadrants or hexahedra are used as well prisms which are generated by cutting the hexahedra in two parts. The hexahedra or prism height is $1m$. The time step is $1 min$.
Simulation parameters for the aquifer and the channel source term are given in Tab.~\ref{GW_ChannelPercolation}.

\subsection{Channel sink term}
%
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}
%

For this example the channel of the previous examples (Sec.~\ref{sec:Groundwater_confined_channelSource}) is located such that flow from the aquifer to the channel takes place. Therefore, the source term represents a steady and uniform rectangular channel located in the aquifer. The setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{GW_riv1_domain}. The simulation time is $30min$.


\subsubsection*{Initial and boundary conditions}
%
Initial groundwater head is $0m$. The channel source term is the boundary condition at one side, at the opposite boundary the head is $0$. At the other boundaries no-flow is imposed.
\subsubsection*{Material properties}
%
The domain is discretization with $24\times 12$ quadrants. The time step size is $1 min$.
Simulation parameters for the aquifer and the channel source term are given in Tab.~\ref{GW_ChannelPercolation}.

\subsection{Theis' Problem}
%
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}
%
Theis' problem examines the transient lowering of the water table induced by a pumping well. Theis' fundamental insight was to recognize that Darcy's law is analogous to the law of the flow of heat by conduction, hydraulic pressure being analogous to temperature, pressure-gradient to thermal gradient.
%
\subsubsection*{Assumptions}
%
\textit{Aquifer:} confined, infinite areal extend, homogeneous, isotropic, uniform thickness, horizontal piezometric surface;\\
\textit{Well:} constant discharge rate, well penetrates the entire thickness, well storage effects can be neglected.\\
%
\subsubsection*{Analytical solution}
The analytical solution of the drawdown as a function of time and distance is expressed by equation ~\ref{theis}:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
h_0 - h(t,x,y) = \frac{Q}{4\pi T}W(u)
\label{theis}
\end{eqnarray}

u = \frac{(x^{2}+y^{2})S}{4Tt}

\section{Time variant flow}

This benchmark is set up to test the implementation of time variant boundary conditions for the \texttt{GROUNDWATER\_FLOW} process. These boundary conditions allow to simulate flow and transport in a flow field, which changes gradient and direction according to user specified functions.

The setup of the model domain is depicted in Figure \ref{time_variant_flow_setup}. The model geometry is designed by 4 corner nodes (gli nodes 0 through 3), which are connected along the model edges by one polyline each. To induce a time variant flow field, time functions are generated externally and are connected to the corner gli nodes. The polyline names and location and the names of the time functions are shown in Figure \ref{time_variant_flow_setup}.

To connect the time functions with the boundary condition, the boundary condition has to be specified along a polyline. The distribution type is \texttt{LINEAR} followed by the number of nodes of the polyline (2) and then by two lines specifying the gli node number, the value at this node and the name of the time function. The value of the time function at the corresponding time is then multiplied by the specified value at the nodes and interpolated to all mesh nodes found along the polyline. This is performed in each timestep. In the case shown here, this was applied for all four boundary condition polylines along the four model area sides.

   3 1.0 BC_left_high
   \end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The model area is 184 m in x direction and 64 m in y direction. Boundary conditions are placed along all four sides of the model area. Hydraulic conductivity is 0.00215 m s$^{-1}$, the storage coefficient is set to 0. Initial conditions are a head of 2.0239 m everywhere.

The benchmark tests at the same time the application of a heterogeneous distribution of the hydraulic conductivity. This is achieved by setting in the *.mmp file:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
 $PERMEABILITY_TENSOR
  ISOTROPIC 1.0
 $PERMEABILITY_DISTRIBUTION
  2d_het_a_kfhet
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The file \texttt{2d\_het\_a\_kfhet} contains the heterogeneous distribution of the hydraulic conductivity, and is generated using an geostatistical simulator. The file contains information on the \texttt{\$MSH\_TYPE}, the \texttt{\$MMP\_TYPE} and specifies options for the interpolation of the values onto the elements of the specified mesh (\texttt{\$DIS\_TYPE}). Under the keyword \texttt{\$DATA} the actual values are specified as x - y - parameter values, where parameter is the hydraulic conductivity. The end of the data set is marked using the keyword \texttt{\#STOP}.

\end{verbatim}
\normalsize




The result of the simulation is shown in Figures \ref{time_variant_heads_results} in top view. The full contours show the piezometric head isolines after the first five time steps, the black and red lines show head isolines from a succession of time steps. It can be seen, that the flow field is turned and directed upwards (black isolines) and back again (red isolines) during the simulation. Figure \ref{time_variant_heads_observationwell} shows the time variant head in an observation well at x=20 m and y=28 m. The rise and fall of the piezometric head due to the time variant flow field can be clearly seen, as well as the initial jump from the initial head to the time variant head.

\section{Unconfined aquifer}
\label{sec:Groundwater_unconfined}
%
\subsection{Steady state case}
%
\subsubsection*{Problem definition}
%
In these examples the aquifer consists of a small strip with the size of $100m \times 2m$ (see Fig.~\ref{GW_Results_uc}). At both ends the head is fixed and constant recharge is imposed on the whole domain which leads to steady state flow. This setting allows comparison with an analytical solution.
%\emph{uc\_quad}, \emph{uc\_tri} solve the two-dimensional Eqn.~\ref{eqn:GW_unconfinedGoverning}  for unconfined auifer and \emph{uc\_pris} solves the three-dimensional groundwater Eqn.\ref{eqn:GW_Governing}.
%
\subsubsection*{Initial and boundary conditions}
%
Initial groundwater head is $0m$. At one end of the strip the head is $1$ at the other $5$. At the top a source term of $1.0\times 10^{-8} m/s$ and at the remaining parts no-flow is imposed.
\subsubsection*{Material properties}
%
For the spatial discretization $100$ equal quadrants and $410$ triangles or prisms are used. In latter case the three-dimensional groundwater Eqn.~\ref{eqn:GW_unconfinedGoverning} is solved with elements adapting to the water height. One time step with the size of $100 s$ is used. The specific storage $S_s = 0 m^{-1}$ or specific yield $S_y = 0$ and a permeability $\kappa$ of $1\times 10^{-9} m^2$ is used.
%
\subsubsection*{Results}
%
Comparison of simulation results for prisms and analytical solution is shown in Fig.~\ref{GW_Results_uc}.
