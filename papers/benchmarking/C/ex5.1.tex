\subsubsection*{Problem definition}

The aim of this example is to simulate the mass transport with the influence of decay, but without any sorption. At the left side of the considered aquifer there is a volume source of 0.1~m$^3$/d, at the right side there is a constant water pressure of 20 kPa. The tracer substance in the source volume is distributed by a stationary flow in the homogeneous aquifer. The mass distribution after 100 days has to be calculated. Figure \ref{fig51} shows a sketch of the calculation area.

\begin{tabbing}
Component: \= no sorption, exclusively decay \\
Aquifer: \> homogeneous, saturated, stationary flow \\
\end{tabbing}

\subsubsection*{Model set-up of the 1~D numerical model}

For the 1-dimensional calculation the calculation area is simplified as a line of a length of 100~m with 100 elements and 101 nodes. As boundary conditions the relative concentration amounts 1 and the source volume of the fluid phase with 0.1~m$^3$/d is given at the left border of the calculation area and a constant pressure of 20 kPa at the right boundary. The used parameters of the soil are listed in table \ref{tab51}. The calculation is divided into 100 time steps with a constant time step length of 1 day. That means, the flow and transport processes in the aquifer within 100 days are simulated.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation method}
The concentration distribution at a special point in time and over a given distance is calculated by equation \ref{eq53}. Hereby the retardation coefficient is set equal to 1. The analytical solutions are depicted in figure \ref{fig52} as single symbols.

\subsubsection*{Results}

In figure \ref{fig52} you can find the concentration distribution over the whole length of the 1~D model at the final simulation time of 100 days. Obviously, the numerical results meet well the analytical solutions.
