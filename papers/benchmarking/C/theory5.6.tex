In contrast to sorption the ion exchange is the replacement of one chemical for another one at the solid surface, the so called ion exchanger. Ion exchange equations do explicitly account for all ions which compete for the exchange sites. The exchange of ions is limited by the exchange capacity, which is the sum of exchangeable ions in the soil and fluctuates with the change of pH in the soil solution. The ion exchanger can be unselective or can have binding preferences for certain ions or classes of ions, depending on their chemical structure (Appelo and Postma, 1996).
