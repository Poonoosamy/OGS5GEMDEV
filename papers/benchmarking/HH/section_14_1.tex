\section{Isothermal Two-Phase Flow}
Temperature effects are ignored and the partially saturated sample is treated as an immiscible two-phase system within the voids of the solid skeleton. In the pressure-pressure formulation the primary variables are (1) gas pressure $\asup{\pres}{g}$ and (2) capillary pressure $\asup{\pres}{c}$. In the pressure-saturation formulation the primary variables are non-wetting phase saturation $S^{nw}$ and wetting-phase pressure $p^{w}$. In the benchmarks shown here, both fluids are assumed incompressible.
